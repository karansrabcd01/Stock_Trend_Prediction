Chatbot Message:
Model view: The current chart pattern looks **Down** to the model. The model is not very confident; signals are mixed. The price has been moving lower. This can indicate selling pressure or weakness in the short term, but bounces can still happen. With a **medium risk profile**, balancing risk and reward is important. You might want to combine trend analysis with fundamentals, news, and proper risk management. For a **short-term horizon**, trends can change quickly. Short-term traders often pay attention to support/resistance levels, volume, and intraday volatility. Note: This is not financial advice. Please do your own research (DYOR) and consider consulting a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
